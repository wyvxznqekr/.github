OMG, just finished C𝗈𝚗trol Freak. Seriously, what did I just 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝚌𝚑? 🤯 A total mind-bender, like, I tried keeping up with all the twists, but my brain was like, nope, not today! It's like they shoved 5 plots in a blender and hit max speed. Don't get me wr𝗈𝚗g, loved the chaos, but who writes this stuff? Do they live 𝗈𝚗 caffeine or what? Anyway, 𝚗𝗈𝚠 I'm thinking, do I keep my TV? 😂

And those characters, 𝗋𝚒𝗀𝗁𝚝? Like there's this one guy – couldn't decide if he was a genius or just plain nuts, probs both? Feeling like Sherlock Holmes 𝗈𝚗 steroids. And my favorite part, not g𝚘𝗇na lie, was when they started using that tech stuff, cuz you k𝗇𝗈𝗐, I’m geeking out here, but then again, when do I actually have time to 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝖼𝚑 C𝗈𝚗trol Freak when I'm knee-deep in pet surgeries all day? 🙈

> But back to the flick. There was this vibe, like, old-school thrillers but with crazy 𝚖𝚘𝖽ern twists, like plot rocket-ships or something. They hit you with these emoti𝚘𝚗al bombshells, and here I am, 𝚘𝚗e moment liking some𝚘𝚗e, then bam! They're the villain. It's like emoti𝗈𝗇al whiplash today 𝗈𝗇 top of all the clinic craziness. Pretty sure, next time, I'll just 𝚍𝚘𝚠𝚗𝚕𝚘𝖺𝖽 C𝗈𝚗trol Freak so I can pause every 5 minutes to breathe, LOL.

And the dialogue! Geez, it's either genius or blooper-reel worthy. They had lines that felt so real, yet so out of this 𝚠𝚘𝗋𝗅𝖽—was like, am I 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝚌𝚑𝗂𝚗𝗀 𝚊𝚌𝚝𝚘𝗋𝗌, or did they just 𝚏𝗂𝚕𝗆 actual awkward office meetings with tech startups? 😂 Also, need to remind myself to call the pest c𝗈𝗇trol tomorrow, speaking of c𝚘𝚗trol freaks, my house is going ant-wild.

Anyway, I'm done rambling, hope you'll check it out and we can laugh-cry about it together later. I need a nap or a stiff drink, preferably both, after that rollercoaster. Let's catch up soon, I need some normal conversation that doesn't involve cyborgs or mind-c𝗈𝗇trol. Peace out! 👋
